# Tensorflow_timeseries
Learning timeseries prediction using tensorflow. Mostly based on [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction) on time series by [Laurence Moroney](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/lmoroney)


### Warning! 

Please note that some of the training data that we used here are stock price data but every model that we build and trained here **is not a tools to decide any real-life financial action**. There are many parameters that affect daily stock price and not just previous historical data. So **do not** use it as your financial decision tool for buying any stock out there.  

The reason we use stock data is because it is one of readily available data for studying a time series forecasting.
